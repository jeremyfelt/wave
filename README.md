# WAVE - WordPress in Ansible for Vagrant or Everywhere

WAVE is an exploration in using Ansible as a provisioner for a nice WordPress setup. The initial focus will be in creating a virtual environment in Vagrant. The secondary focus will be to expand that environment to a production server as well.

## Getting Started

1. Install Virtualbox 4.2.18
1. Install Vagrant 1.3.1
1. `brew install ansible`
1. Get this repo in a directory
1. `vagrant up`
